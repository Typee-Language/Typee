Current developments are in _Python 3.6_, based on _Anaconda 3_, with _Eclipse Photon_ framework and _PyDev_ plug-in.
Windows is currently used also for these developments. So, if you get Linux expertise you're welcome!


## What is Typhon?

__Typhon__ is an Object Oriented Programming language. Its syntax is derived from other OOP language such as _C++11_, _Java 8.0_ and _Python 3.6_.


### Rationale

At first, this was a personnal project. It aimed at developping an upper layer to Python with a true type verification. This had already been partially addressed by Google with their project [PyType](https://opensource.google.com/projects/pytype). The kind of annotations this project proposes is now widely accepted and inserted in new Python code. PyType is a static analyzer that infers and checks types for Python code.

```Pytype is a static type inferencer and type checker for Python code. It is capable of analyzing existing Python code to determine what possible types could be used on APIs throughout the program.``` (source: Google project PyType)

Well. This is not exactly full type checking - while it is perfectly adapted to Python programming for which no type declaration is needed before manipulating objects.

But we wanted to get a typed language to further translate it in Python code, full static type checking having been done before automatically generating Python modules then running the Python interpreter on them.


### Typhon: neither compiled nor interpreted but translated

Traditionnal OOP languages are either compiled (e.g. C++) or interpreted (e.g. Python). They even may be first compiled into an intermediate code which is then interpreted (e.g. Java and its Bytecode interpreted by a Java Virtual Machine that has to be implemented on each of the different targetted devices).

__Typhon__ is neither compiled nor interpreted. It is rather translated into other OOP languages, such as _Python_ which chronologically is the first addressed OOP language from: _Python_, _C++_ and _Java_. During the translation, type infering and checking is done not only for APIs as does PyType but also on all the other parts of the code.

While this may seem to be valuable for untyped languages such as _Python_, it should appear to be not useful for other typed languages, of course.
Yes, but wait...


### Typhon: one code for many implementations

Here is the core usefulness of __Typhon__: once a program has been written in _Typhon_, it can then easily be translated in any other available OOP language. At first, this will be a translator to _Python_. But as soon as other translators will be available, e.g. for _C++_ or _Java_, the same code will be available for translation in these languages also.

As long as related libraries are added to the package (for instance graphical ones or GPU parallel programming ones) and are programmed in __Typhon__ with dedicated code (i.e. native embedded code) for the targetted OOP language, it should be easy to program applications for Windows, Linux, iOS or Android with a single code programmed in __Typhon__.

Here we are!


## Typhon language characteristics

We list here only the main characteristics of __Typhon__.

- Object Oriented Programming;
- typed variables and objects;
- classical scalar types;
- Templated on functions, methods and __operators__ - as with templates in _C++_ and generics in _Java_ while with bonuses on operators;
- auto typing in specific cases - as with `auto` in _C++_ and as is by default in _Python_;
- 'for' and 'if' comprehensions - as in _Python_;
- built-in containers for objects - as in _Python_: `list`, `set`, `dict`, plus `array`;
- classical instructions plus bonuses - e.g. `else` associated with `for` and `while` as in _Python_ or with `switch`;
- classical exception handling;
- classical operators plus a few bonuses - e.g. 0-shifting as built in _Java_;
- few undefined operators available for users specific definitions;
- unnamed functions - as in _Java_ or _Python_ lambdas;
- an `embed` instruction for the embedding of native code in _Python_, _C++_ or _Java_ for instance;
- and few other goodies you will enjoy to use.

While navigating in [Typhon GitHub repository](https://github.com/schmouk/Typhon) you will find numerous documentation on __Typhon__ grammar specification, the __Typhon__ translator software architecture (see short description below) or the whole software documentation - as generated in HTML by an open source application, _PyYadc_ (Yet another documentation compiler).

Please be aware that this project is under construction and that currently NO running version is available. Documentation as well as directories tree and their contents are highly subject to change, actually on a daily or at least on a weekly basis.

## Typhon global architecture

__Typhon__ has been specified as would have been any compiler. Our bedside book for a long has been "Engineering a Compiler, 2nd Edition, Keith D.Cooper & Linda Torczon, Elsevier, 2012" and we encourage the reader to read this book.
We have choosen this book because it was newer than the famous Dragoon book "Compilers, principles, techniques, & tools, 2nd ed." from Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Ethi and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Pearson-Addison Wesley, 2007, while this Dragoon book had been used to specify the _Python_ interpretor.


### Global architecture of a compiler

A compiler is composed of a __front-end__, a __back-end__ and an __optimizer__.


#### The Front-End

It contains a __scanner__ that scans the code and generates a first level of intermediate code: the _tokenized_ code.

The generated tokenized code is provided to a __parser__ that parses the tokens and generates a second level of intermediate code: the _IC_. The _parser_ parses this code and checks it for syntax correctness. Syntax errors are emitted during this step of the compilation.

The generated _IC_ is finally passed to an __elaborator__ that elaborates all the other checkings - such as types infering and checking, for instance. Not declared variables or objects, or types errors are emitted during this step of the compilation.


#### The Back-End

It generates the final binary code for the targetted processing unit. It gets as input the intermediate code _IC_ as generated by the __elaborator__ of the __Front-End__ once this _IC_ has been fully checked and validated. The __Back-End__ output is a binary file that contains either executable code within a targetted _Operating System_ or binary code and linkage metadata to be later linked with other code.


#### The Optimizer

According to the targetted processing unit, it optimizes the finally generated binary code. According to the _IC_ generated by the __Front-End__ it may also provide optimizations within the _IC_, e.g. by duplicating code of small functions rather than calling them (speed optimization) or by removing dead code as long as this can be statically detected (space optimization).


### Global architecture of Typhon

Well, __Typhon__ is a translator not a compiler. So, we only implement the __Front-End__ and the __Back-End__ steps of a compiler.


#### Typhon Front-End

As for any compiler, __Typhon__ gets a __scanner__ for the tokenization of the code, a __parser__ for syntax checking and an __elaborator__ for undeclared variables detection, types infering and types checking.

It generates an _Intermediate Code_ and passes it to the _Back-End_ as long as all checks are ok.


#### Typhon Back-End

The __Typhon__ _Back-End_ finalizes the translation to the targetted programming language. Remember, as a first step, _Python_ is the targetted language. _C++_ and _Java_ will come next.

According to this, the _Back-End_ of __Typhon__ contains as many generators as targetted languages, each of them generating the corresponding code to be either interpreted (_Python_) or compiled (_C++_, _Java_) with the corresponding interpreter / compiler.


#### Optimizer

__Typhon__ implements no _optimizer_. This step is left to the final interpreters and compilers that will do a definitively correct  job.


#### Final step

The final step for the user is then to run the compiler or the interpretor of the targetted language. Of course, this step can be automated via scripting and __Typhon__ project aims at providing such scripts to ease the whole process.


## That's it

Enjoy!
