# Using Visual Studio Code IDE as your framework for Typee

VSCode allows for the installing of extensions. Here are the few 
ones we have installed  with our VSC framework:

- Anaconda Extension Pack (1.0.1 by the date of this publication)
- Code Runner (0.9.11 by the date of this publication)
- Python (2019.6.24221 by the date of this publication)
- Python Extension Pack (1.6.0 by the date of this publication)
- Python for VSCode (0.2.3 by the date of this publication)
- Visual Studio IntelliCode (1.1.8 by the date of this publication)

You are free to install any other ones, but these are the ones 
we are currently using. Furthermore, it might be that some of these 
extensions are redundant... Well, we have not yet checked.

Nevertheless, Enjoy!
