The subdirectories here contain configuration and project files to
be able to use Visual Studio Code (VSC) as your favorite IDE to work 
on __Typee__ language project.

This directory is currently empty.

As soon as we will have started working with VSC, those files will 
be directly accessible here, according to the different successive 
versions of VSC we will have used.

You will then just have to copy thse files at the root reictory of 
your local clone of __Typee__ to be able to work with your version 
of VSC.


Enjoy!
