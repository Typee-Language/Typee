# Using eclipse IDE as your framework for Typee

The subdirectories here contain each files
- `.project` and
- `.Pydevproject`.

To be able to use eclipse as your framework to work on **Typee**, 
just copy those two files into the main directory of your local 
clone of **Typee** Github repository, copy files from:


- `Eclipse 2019-03` or
- `Eclipse 2019-06` or
- `Eclipse 2019-09` or
- `Eclipse 2020-03` or
- `Eclipse 2020-06`

according to the version of Eclipse you use.
Caution: these versions of Eclipse are each related to a specific Python version. For isntance, `Eclipse 2020-06` is bound to Python 3.8`. You may wish to not use these files to configure your own environment

Enjoy!
