The subdirectories here contain each files
- `.project` and
- `.Pydevproject`.

To be able to use eclipse as your framework to work on __Typee__, 
just copy those two files into the main directory of your local 
clone of __TYpee__ Github repository, copy files from:


- `Eclipse 2019-03` or
- `Eclipse 2019-06` or
- `Eclipse 2019-09` or
- `Eclipse 2020-03`

according to the version of Eclipse you use.

Enjoy!
