The subdirectories here contain each files
- `.project` and
- `.Pydevproject`.

To be able to use eclipse as your framework to work on __Typee__, 
just copy those two files into the main directory of your local 
clone of __TYpee__ Github repository, copy files from:

- `Eclipse 2019-03` if you are using this version of eclipse;
- `Eclipse 2019-06` if you are using this newer version of eclipse;

Enjoy!
