# Typee automated software documentation

The software documentation of __Typee__ is automated by the use of fair 
utility __PyYadc__ (https://github.com/schmouk/pyYadc).

To further automate this automated documentation, we have imported PyYadc
source code into __Typee__ directories tree and we have implemented a _Python_
script to automate the generation of the S/W documentation of __Typee_ code.

First, have a look in directory 
`Typee/_Global_Documentation/Typee_Softxare_Documentation`. You will find 
there two interesting files:

1. `typee_software_doc.html`, and
2. `typee_automated_documentation_script.py`.


## 1. `typee_software_doc.html`

The software documentation of __Typee__ is generated by PyYadc in an HTML
form. It describes every _package_ of the software and for each of these,
every _Python module_. Every classes, consts and documentation comments in
each _module_ is also described in there.

This is the official Software documentation of __Typee__.

To generate it, just run the next _Python_ script


## 2. Automated script `typee_automated_documentation_script.py`

You may either run this script at command line in any kind of console

    $ python typee_automated_documentation_script.py

or run it from your favorite Python development framework (remember, coders
are strongly recommended to use Eclipse Photon on Windows, for which file
`.pydevproject` at root directory contains all the needed stuff (notably, the 
PYTHON_PATH set for you) to be able to run this script directly within the 
framework.
