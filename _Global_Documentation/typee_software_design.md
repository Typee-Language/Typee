This document describes the global software design of the __Typee__ 
translator. We first explain how we have decided to design this translator. 
Since this design has been largely inspired by _compilers_ general design, we 
explain then how modern compilers are designed. In the third section, we
explain the derivative way we have used to design the __Typee__ translator.
Finally, we list packages and their roles as well as modules in packages and
the role of each of them also.

We expect this document to help the reader to understand how the __Typee__ 
translator has been thought and designed with programming language _Python_, 
and help anyone who would like to contribute to understand what enhancements 
could be proposed and how they could be designed and implemented.

## 1. Typee Design Concepts

__Typee__ is an Object Oriented Programming language. Its syntax is derived 
from other OOP language such as _C++11_, _Java 8.0_ and _Python 3.6_.

Traditionnal OOP languages are either compiled (e.g. C++) or interpreted (e.g. 
_Python_ ). They even may be first compiled into an intermediate code which is 
then interpreted (e.g. Java and its Bytecode interpreted by a 
_Java Virtual Machine_ that has to be implemented on each of the different 
targetted devices).

Meanwhile, __Typee__ language is neither compiled nor interpreted. It is 
rather translated into other OOP languages, such as _Python_ (which 
chronologically is the first addressed OOP language from: _Python_, _C++_ and 
_Java_). During the translation, type infering and checking is done not only 
for APIs but also on all the other parts of the code.

So, we got greatly inspired by modern compilers design to design the __Typee__ 
translator. Our bedside book for a long has been "Engineering a Compiler, 2nd 
Edition, Keith D.Cooper & Linda Torczon, Elsevier, 2012" and we encourage the 
reader to read this book.

We have choosen this book because it was newer than the famous Dragoon book 
"Compilers, principles, techniques, & tools, 2nd ed." from Alfred V. Aho, 
Monica S. Lam, Ravi Ethi and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Pearson-Addison Wesley, 2007, 
while this Dragoon book had been used to specify the _Python_ interpretor 
_CPython_.



## 2. Modern Compilers Design

By 2018, modern compilers are designed with three distinct communicating 
software modules: the _Front-End_, the _Back-End_ and the _Optimizer_. A 
drawing will be simpler to understand.

![Three phase compiler design picture](Picts/three-phase-compiler.png)

First, the source code to be compiled is processed by the compiler 
_Front-End_. During this phase, the source code is _scanned_ to detect key 
words, numbers, identifiers and the like and _parsed_ to check its syntax 
correctness. The _Front-End_ transfers to the compiler _Optimier_ an internal 
representation of the source code, which is noted __I.C.__ (Intermediate Code) 
in the above picture.

Second, the I.C. is processed by the _Optimizier_ whose job is to statically 
optimize the intermediate code. For instance, this consists in the deleting of 
dead code or in the transforming of never-changing variables content into 
constant values. Many other optimizations may be generated by the _Optimizer_.
A new version of the intermediate code, the optimized one, is then passed to 
the compiler _Back-End_.

Third, the optimized version of the I.C. is processed by the _Back-End_.
There, the final binary code to be ran on the target processor is generated. 
Final static optimizations may be generated during this phase also, according 
to the specificies of the target process unit.

Well, this is for the design of three-phase compilers, but two-phase compilers 
exist also, with no _Optimizer_ phase. See coresponding schema below.

## 3. Typee Translator Design -- from Compiler design

The __Typee__ design is simpler than a compiler one, since __Typee__ is a 
__translator__, not a compiler.

Why is it simpler? Because, as a translator, Typee neither compiles nor 
optimizes code. Its two main acitivities are _static type checking_ and 
_translation_ from programming language Typee to another programming language 
such as _Python_, _C++_ or _Java_.

Nevertheless, it is easy to envisage the design of Typee transator as would be 
the design of a modern compiler.
