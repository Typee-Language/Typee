This document describes the global software design of the __Typee__ 
translator. We first explain how we have decided to design this translator. 
Since this design has been largely inspired by _compilers_ general design, we 
explain then how modern compilers are designed. In the third section, we
explain the derivative way we have used to design the __Typee__ translator.
Finally, we list packages and their roles as well as modules in packages and
the role of each of them also.

We expect this document to help the reader to understand how the __Typee__ 
translator has been thought and designed with programming language _Python_, 
and help anyone who would like to contribute to understand what enhancements 
could be proposed and how they could be designed and implemented.

## 1. Typee Design Concepts

__Typee__ is an Object Oriented Programming language. Its syntax is derived 
from other OOP language such as _C++11_, _Java 8.0_ and _Python 3.6_.

Traditionnal OOP languages are either compiled (e.g. C++) or interpreted (e.g. 
_Python_ ). They even may be first compiled into an intermediate code which is 
then interpreted (e.g. Java and its Bytecode interpreted by a 
_Java Virtual Machine_ that has to be implemented on each of the different 
targetted devices).

Meanwhile, __Typee__ language is neither compiled nor interpreted. It is 
rather translated into other OOP languages, such as _Python_ (which 
chronologically is the first addressed OOP language from: _Python_, _C++_ and 
_Java_). During the translation, type infering and checking is done not only 
for APIs but also on all the other parts of the code.

So, we got greatly inspired by modern compilers design to design the __Typee__ 
translator. Our bedside book for a long has been "Engineering a Compiler, 2nd 
Edition, Keith D.Cooper & Linda Torczon, Elsevier, 2012" and we encourage the 
reader to read this book.

We have choosen this book because it was newer than the famous Dragoon book 
"Compilers, principles, techniques, & tools, 2nd ed." from Alfred V. Aho, 
Monica S. Lam, Ravi Ethi and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Pearson-Addison Wesley, 2007, 
while this Dragoon book had been used to specify the _Python_ interpretor 
_CPython_.



## 2. Modern Compilers Design

By 2018, modern compilers are designed with three distinct communicating 
software modules: the _Front-End_, the _Back-End_ and the _Optimizer_. A 
drawing will be simpler to understand.

![Three phase compiler design picture](Picts/three-phase-compiler.png)

First, the source code to be compiled is processed by the compiler 
_Front-End_. During this phase, the source code is _scanned_ to detect key 
words, numbers, identifiers and the like and _parsed_ to check its syntax 
correctness. The _Front-End_ transfers to the compiler _Optimizer_ an internal 
representation of the source code, which is noted __I.C.__ (Intermediate Code) 
in the above picture.

Second, the I.C. is processed by the _Optimizier_ whose job is to statically 
optimize the intermediate code. For instance, this consists in the deleting of 
dead code or in the transforming of never-changing variables content into 
constant values. Many other optimizations may be generated by the _Optimizer_.
A new version of the intermediate code, the optimized one, is then passed to 
the compiler _Back-End_.

Third, the optimized version of the I.C. is processed by the _Back-End_.
There, the final binary code to be ran on the target processor is generated. 
Final static optimizations may be generated during this phase also, according 
to the specificities of the target process unit.

Well, this is for the design of three-phase compilers, but two-phase compilers 
exist also, with no _Optimizer_ phase. See coresponding schema below.

![Two phase compiler design picture](Picts/two-phase-compiler.png)

To get a little bit more information on those three phases of a modern 
compiler, see the three next sub-sections. They are short. But to know more, 
the reader should refer to any book on compilers design. Remember, the one we 
have used for the design of Typee translator is "_Engineering a Compiler_",
2nd edtition, Keith D.Cooper & Linda Torczon, 2012, Elsevier, ISBN 
978-0-12-088478-0.


### 2.1 The _Front-End_

The __Front-End__ of a compiler is a three-phase module. See figure below.

![Front-end design picture](Picts/front-end.png)

Explanations are provided in the next three subsections.


#### 2.1.1 the _Scanner_

![Front-end scanner picture](Picts/front-end-scanner.png)

The source code to be compiled is first scanned by the _Scanner_. This module 
transforms the source code to an ordered list of tokens. This phase of the 
__Front-End__ is named also _tokenizer_.

What is a token? It is an entity that describes a whole atomic element of the 
programming language. For instance, there is one token for each of the 
built-in instructions of the language (e.g. ___for___, ___if___, ___else___ 
just to name a few, which are associated with resp. to _token_FOR_, _token_IF_ 
and token_ELSE). Numbers are associated with one token. Identifiers are also, 
whatever they identify: constants, variables, functions, classes or methods, 
etc. Operators are each associated also with tokens (e.g. '=', '+', '<=', 
etc.) Each token is a data structure that may contain local information, such 
as, for instance, the line number and the column index of the corresponding 
text, and this text itself (e.g. for an identiifer or for a scalar constant).

So, the _Scanner_ takes as input the source code to be scanned and puts as its 
output some _intermdiate code_ (I.C.) which is mainly an ordered list of 
detected tokens. This ordered list is then the input of the next phase of the 
__Front-End__, the _Parser_. Let's call it the _tokenized I.C._


#### 2.1.2 the _Parser_

![Front-end parser picture](Picts/front-end-parser.png)

The _tokenized intermediate code_ is passed as input to the _Parser_. This 
module parses this I.C. and checks for its correctness according to the 
specified syntax of the programming language.

Such a syntax is defined by its _grammar_. The rules defined this grammar 
describes what are the legal successions of tokens for the defined programming 
language. For instance, in C++, a legal ___if___ instruction is defined to be 
something like this:

```java
if ( <some test> )
    <a block of instructions or a single instruction>
else
    <another block of instructions or another single instruction>
```

Should any token corresponding to the parenthesis be missing after token 
_token_IF_ in the tokenized I.C, the _Scanner_ would detect some syntax error 
in the source code. The __Front-End__ may then inform the user of these 
syntax errors and most often does not try to correct them.

The output of the _Parser_ is another form of _intermediate code_ which still 
lists the tokens in the order of their appearing in the source code plus maybe 
some information about the syntax used and the maybe detected errors in the 
source code. This _parsed intermediate code_ is then the input of the last 
phase of the __Front-End__, the _Elaborator_. 


#### 2.1.3 the _Elaborator_

![Front-end elaborator picture](Picts/front-end-elaborator.png)

The _parsed intermediate code_ gets statically elaborated in the last phase of 
the __Front-End__, the _Elaborator_. This module finalizes the Front-End 
operations to check for the semantic correctness of the source code.

Among the many elaborations that can take place, we list only two of them just 
for illustrating the kind of processing the _Elaborator_ runs.

##### Identifiers Checking

The use of identifiers is checked. Is an identifier associated with a constant 
value? Or is it the name of a function, of a class, of a method or of a 
variable? According to this information, is it used in a correct way. For 
instance, by no way should an _Elaborator_ accept the modification of the 
value associated with the identifier of a constant value, as long as the 
programming language allows declarations of constants. Meanwhile, by no way 
the identifier of a scalar variable should be used as a called function.

##### Types inferring and checking

Another kind of elaboration of a source code is the inferring of types (for 
variables and for expressions) and the checking of the correctness of those 
types use. For instance, assigning a long scalar in a variable with shorter 
scalar type may be an issue, and be considered as a warning or as an error 
according to the programming language defined policy.

This type checking is of most importance for typed programming languages. When 
done at compile time, i.e. in a static manner, it allows the static detection 
of possible errors at run time __before__ running the final binary code. This 
way, no type checking, which is costly, has to be implemented at run time.

##### _Elaborator_ output

The _Elaborator_ provides either a list of detected errors or a new form of 
_Intermediate Code_ that we will call the _elaborated I.C._

The errors delivered by the _Elaborator_ may have been detected: by the 
_Scanner_, about badly formed or unknown detected tokens; by the _Parser_, 
about syntax errors; and by the _Elaborator_, for instance about types usage 
errors. Whatever the detected errors, they most often are printed on a console 
or in a log file.

The _elaborated I.C_, if source code has been detected as free of errors by 
the __Front-End__, is then passed to the second phase of the compiler, which 
is the _Optimizer_ for three-phase compilers, or the _Back-End_ for two-phase 
compilers.



### 2.2 The _Optimizer_



### 2.3 The _Back-End_






## 3. Typee Translator Design -- from Compiler design

The __Typee__ design is simpler than a compiler one, since __Typee__ is a 
__translator__, not a compiler.

Why is it simpler? Because, as a translator, Typee neither compiles nor 
optimizes code. Its two main acitivities are _static type checking_ and 
_translation_ from programming language Typee to another programming language 
such as _Python_, _C++_ or _Java_.

Nevertheless, it is easy to envisage the design of Typee transator as would be 
the design of a modern compiler.
