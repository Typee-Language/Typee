This document describes the global software design of the __Typee__ 
translator. We first explain how we have decided to design this translator. 
Since this design has been largely inspired by _compilers_ general design, we 
explain then how modern compilers are designed. In the third section, we
explain the derivative way we have used to design the __Typee__ translator.
Finally, we list packages and their roles as well as modules in packages and
the role of each of them also.

We expect this document to help the reader to understand how the __Typee__ 
translator has been thought and designed with programming language _Python_, 
and help anyone who would like to contribute to understand what enhancements 
could be proposed and how they could be designed and implemented.
