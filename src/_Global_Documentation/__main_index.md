# Software Global Documentation - Index for all documents

This is the index of all documents provided for the description or the
specification of __Typee__ software architecture, modules and files.

It is part of the overall documentation of __Typee__ and could be used for
the feeding of the related __http://www.typee.ovh__ web site, placed at pages
dedicated to developers.


## List of documents

| Name  | Place  | Comments  |
|---|---|---|
| scanner_tokenization_tests.md  | src/Tests/Documentation-README  | Explanations on how to test the Front-End Scanner and how to modify related tests files  |
| README.md  | reporitory root  | General description of __TYpee__ project and language  |


(notice to contributors: either try to maintain this index in alphabetical
order, and as soon as this would be useful create as many tables as 
interesting topics, grouping related documents by topics - in which case a 
same document could be appearing in multiple topics)
