/**
Pseudo-random numbers generator  - Definition of a fast 32-bits Multiple Recursive
Generator with long period (3.98e+438).

Multiple Recursive Generators (MRGs)  use  recurrence  to  evaluate  pseudo-random
numbers suites. Recurrence is of the form:

   x(i) = A * SUM[ x(i-k) ]  mod M,

for 2 to more different values of k.

MRGs offer very large periods with the best known results  in  the  evaluation  of 
their  randomness,  as  stated  in  the  evaluation  done  by  Pierre L'Ecuyer and 
Richard Simard (Université de Montréal)  in "TestU01:  A C Library  for  Empirical 
Testing of Random  Number Generators  - ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 
vol.33 n.4, pp.22-40, August 2007".  It is recommended to use  such  pseudo-random
numbers generators rather than LCG ones for serious simulation applications.

The implementation of this MRG 31-bits model is  based  on  DX-47-3  pseudo-random
generator  proposed  by  Deng  and  Lin.  The  DX-47-3 version uses the recurrence

    x(i) = (2^26+2^19) * (x(i-1) + x(i-24) + x(i-47)) mod (2^31-1)
    
and offers a period of about 2^1457  - i.e. nearly 4.0e+438 - with low computation
time.

See Rand287 for  a  short  period  MR-Generator (2^287,  i.e. 2.49e+86)  with  low
computation time but 256 32-bits integers memory consumption.
See Rand49507  for  a  far  longer  period  (2^49507,  i.e. 1.2e+14903)  with  low 
computation  time  too  (31-bits  modulus)  but  use  of  more  memory space (1597 
32-bits integers).
  
Furthermore this class is callable.
Example:
  Rand1457 rand = Rand1457();
  print( rand() );    // prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, 1.0)
  print( rand(a) );   // prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [0.0, a)
  print( rand(a,b) ); // prints a uniform pseudo-random value within [a  , b)

Notice that for simulating the roll of a dice you should code this way:

  Rand1457 diceRoll = Rand1457();
  print( int(diceRoll(1, 7)) ); // prints a uniform roll within set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Reminder:
We give you here below a copy of the table of tests for the MRGs that have 
been implemented in Libs.Random, as provided in paper "TestU01, ..." - see
file README.md.

* _small crush_ is a small set of simple tests that quickly tests some  of
the expected characteristics for a pretty good PRG;
* _crush_ is a bigger set of tests that test more deeply  expected  random 
characteristics;
* _big crush_ is the ultimate set of difficult tests  that  any  GOOD  PRG 
should definitively pass.
