# Testing the Front-End Scanner

Current directory contains all the needed stuff to validate any modification brought to the Front-End Scanner, in an as automated way as possible while being kept simple.

The only script to run for this purpose is contained in module `script_scanner_test.py` within directory `src/Tests/Scanner_Tokens`.
Users may run this script as a command line in a console window, in directory `Scanner_Tokens`:

    $ python script_scanner_test.py

or run it from within any developement framework - remember, _Eclipse Photon_ is the recommended one with __Typee__.
